'''\
The script reads <stdin> line by line and computes metrics

input format: <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" \
<status code> <file size>
    > lines formatted differently will be skipped

After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C),
these statistics are printed:
    > Total file size: "File size: <total size>"
        where <total size> is the sum of all previous <file size>
    > For each status code appeared a line is printed containing the number \
of lines with that status code: "<status code>: <number of lines>"
        > possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
        > if a status code doesnâ€™t appear or is not an integer, no \
corresponding line is printed
        > status codes will be printed in ascending order
